    <h2>Personal Skills and Qualities</h2>
    <p>
      I’m a 2nd-year Computer Science student with experience in Java, C++,
      Python, and assembly language (Irvine 32). I understand operating systems,
      hardware components, and discrete math, and I’ve worked a bit with
      databases and have a basic idea of web design. I’m detail-oriented,
      especially with low-level programming, and enjoy tackling challenging
      problems. While I’m still learning more about web development and
      databases, I’m always eager to improve. I value teamwork and clear
      communication, and I’m excited to keep growing in the field.
